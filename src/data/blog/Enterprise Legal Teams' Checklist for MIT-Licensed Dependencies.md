# Enterprise Legal Teams' Checklist for MIT-Licensed Dependencies

With 44.7% of GitHub projects using MIT License and 97% of commercial software containing open source components, enterprise legal teams face unprecedented complexity in managing MIT-licensed dependencies. Despite MIT's reputation for simplicity, compliance failures remain widespreadâ€”56% of audited applications contain license conflicts, many involving basic MIT attribution requirements.

This comprehensive checklist provides legal teams with systematic approaches to MIT License compliance, risk assessment, and ongoing monitoring. Built from industry best practices and real-world compliance challenges, these guidelines help enterprises capture the benefits of MIT-licensed software while avoiding legal pitfalls.

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Inventory

### Complete Component Discovery

**1. Conduct Comprehensive Software Inventory**
- Document all MIT-licensed components across your entire software portfolio
- Include direct dependencies and transitive dependencies (libraries your dependencies use)
- Cover all software types: web applications, mobile apps, embedded systems, internal tools
- Use automated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for accurate discovery

**2. Version Tracking and Documentation**
- Record exact versions of each MIT-licensed component
- Maintain historical records of version changes and upgrades
- Document the specific MIT License variant used (some projects use modified versions)
- Track component lifecycle from adoption through removal

**3. Usage Context Analysis**
- Identify how each MIT-licensed component is integrated into your software
- Determine distribution scope: internal use, customer deployment, public release
- Assess modification status: used as-is vs. modified versions
- Document integration methods: static linking, dynamic linking, embedded, or standalone

### Legal Risk Assessment

**4. Patent Vulnerability Evaluation**
- Flag MIT-licensed components that may involve patented technology
- Assess patent litigation risk in your industry and geographic markets
- Consider alternative licenses (Apache 2.0) for patent-sensitive components
- Document rationale for accepting MIT's lack of explicit patent protection

**5. License Interaction Analysis**
- Review license compatibility between MIT and other components in your software
- Identify potential conflicts when MIT-licensed code combines with other licenses
- Document license "upgrade" scenarios where permissive licenses become more restrictive
- Ensure combined licensing doesn't create unexpected obligations

## Phase 2: Attribution Compliance Framework

### Core Attribution Requirements

**6. Copyright Notice Preservation**
- Verify original copyright notices remain intact in all MIT-licensed code
- Document copyright holders and dates for each component
- Ensure copyright information survives compilation, minification, or bundling processes
- Maintain copyright accuracy through component updates and modifications

**7. License Text Inclusion**
- Include complete MIT License text with every distribution
- Create standardized attribution documentation for different distribution methods
- Ensure license text accompanies both source code and binary distributions
- Verify attribution survives deployment and packaging processes

**8. Attribution Location Standards**
- Establish consistent attribution locations across different software types
- For web applications: dedicated license pages, footer notices, or bundled attribution files
- For mobile apps: settings screens, about dialogs, or help documentation
- For embedded systems: README files, configuration interfaces, or printed documentation

### Distribution-Specific Requirements

**9. Binary Distribution Compliance**
- Include attribution information with compiled applications and libraries
- Create automated processes to generate attribution documentation during builds
- Ensure end-user applications display required attribution information
- Verify attribution persists through software updates and patches

**10. Web Application Compliance**
- Address the breakdown in web developer compliance with attribution requirements
- Implement automated tools to track and display client-side dependencies
- Create clear attribution for JavaScript libraries and frameworks
- Establish processes for dynamic loading and single-page application scenarios

**11. Mobile Application Standards**
- Include attribution in app store descriptions, settings screens, or dedicated license views
- Address platform-specific attribution requirements (iOS, Android guidelines)
- Ensure attribution survives app updates and over-the-air deployments
- Consider user accessibility requirements for attribution display

## Phase 3: Ongoing Compliance Management

### Continuous Monitoring

**12. Automated Compliance Tracking**
- Implement automated tools to detect new MIT-licensed dependencies
- Monitor component updates that might introduce new attribution requirements
- Track license changes in existing dependencies (projects sometimes change licenses)
- Set up alerts for compliance-affecting changes in your software supply chain

**13. Development Process Integration**
- Establish clear policies and procedures for open source license compliance
- Train development teams on MIT License requirements and common pitfalls
- Implement pre-commit hooks or CI/CD checks for license compliance
- Create standardized approval processes for new MIT-licensed dependencies

**14. Regular Compliance Audits**
- Conduct periodic comprehensive reviews of MIT License compliance
- Verify attribution accuracy and completeness across all distributions
- Test compliance in different deployment scenarios and customer environments
- Document compliance status and remediation plans for any violations

### Risk Management and Documentation

**15. Compliance Documentation**
- Maintain comprehensive records of all MIT-licensed components and their compliance status
- Document compliance decisions and rationale for legal defensibility
- Create standardized templates for attribution notices and license documentation
- Preserve historical compliance records for audit and due diligence purposes

**16. Vendor and Contractor Management**
- Extend compliance requirements to third-party developers and vendors
- Include MIT License compliance obligations in development contracts
- Require compliance verification from external development teams
- Establish processes for compliance transfer during vendor transitions

## Phase 4: Strategic Compliance Considerations

### M&A and Due Diligence Preparation

**17. Due Diligence Readiness**
- Prepare comprehensive MIT License compliance documentation for potential transactions
- Identify and remediate compliance gaps before they become deal impediments
- Create compliance summaries that highlight risk mitigation efforts
- Document compliance costs and ongoing obligations for acquirer assessment

**18. Compliance Remediation Planning**
- Develop standard procedures for addressing compliance violations
- Create escalation processes for serious compliance issues
- Establish timelines and resource allocation for remediation efforts
- Document lessons learned and process improvements from compliance incidents

### Organizational Policies

**19. Policy Development and Enforcement**
- Create organization-wide policies governing MIT License usage and compliance
- Establish clear approval processes for adopting new MIT-licensed dependencies
- Define roles and responsibilities for compliance monitoring and enforcement
- Implement training programs for developers, legal teams, and management

**20. Strategic License Planning**
- Evaluate MIT License alignment with business strategy and risk tolerance
- Consider alternative licenses for projects where MIT's limitations are problematic
- Plan for license changes or dual-licensing strategies where appropriate
- Assess competitive implications of MIT License choices

## Implementation Best Practices

### Tool Selection and Integration

**Automated Compliance Tools**: Implement SCA tools like Black Duck, FOSSA, or WhiteSource that can automatically identify MIT-licensed components and track compliance requirements.

**Documentation Systems**: Use centralized systems to maintain compliance documentation, attribution notices, and audit trails.

**Development Integration**: Integrate compliance checking into CI/CD pipelines to prevent non-compliant code from reaching production.

### Cultural Change Management

**Training and Awareness**: Establish clear policies, procedures, and guidelines for open source license compliance within your organization. Address the cultural disconnect between MIT's perceived simplicity and actual compliance requirements.

**Process Standardization**: Create repeatable processes that don't rely on individual knowledge or manual tracking. Ensure consistent compliance across distributed teams and organizations.

**Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and refinement of compliance processes based on industry best practices and internal lessons learned.

## Conclusion

MIT License compliance appears simple but requires systematic attention to detail and organizational commitment. The high rate of license conflicts (56% of applications) demonstrates that even "simple" licenses require robust compliance processes.

This checklist provides a foundation for enterprise legal teams to manage MIT-licensed dependencies effectively. Success requires combining automated tools with clear policies, ongoing training, and regular auditing. Organizations that implement comprehensive MIT License compliance programs position themselves for confident open source adoption while avoiding the legal and business risks that affect the majority of commercial software users.

Remember: MIT License compliance is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that must evolve with your software, organization, and the broader open source ecosystem. Regular review and refinement of these processes ensures continued compliance and risk mitigation.
